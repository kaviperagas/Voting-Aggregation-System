## How to Run
To run the Sunshine Voting Aggregation System, compile all the files in the /src directory, then run SunshineApp.java.
A GUI will be prompted. Please enter the path of the input file if it's in a different directory or just the name of the file if it's in the same directory.
The results of the election will be displayed on the screen and a media and an audit file will be generated.
