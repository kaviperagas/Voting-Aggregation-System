## Description
 - Sunshine Voting Aggregation System calculates the results of different types of elections, given the ballots.
 - The ballots contain the type of election (popularity only, instant-runoff, and open party list), the names of candidates, the number of ballots, and these ballots.
 - Most of the features were implemented using the Waterfall methodology (see repo named Waterfall) and some additional features were implemented using Agile (see repo named Agile).
