## How to Run
To run the Sunshine Voting Aggregation System, compile all the files in the /src directory, then run SunshineApp.java. A GUI will be prompted. Please enter the path of the input file if it's in a different directory or just the name of the file if it's in the same directory. The results of the election will be displayed on the screen and a media and an audit file will be generated.

## Description
 - Sunshine Voting Aggregation System calculates the results of different types of elections, given the ballots.
 - The ballots contain the type of election (popularity only, instant-runoff, and open party list), the names of candidates, the number of ballots, and these ballots.
 - The results are displayed on the screen and a media and an audit file are generated.
 - Most of the features were implemented using the Waterfall methodology (see repo named Waterfall) and some additional features were implemented using Agile (see repo named Agile).
